# LOL Info
LOL Info started as a hobby project to create a spring CLI which could be installed on a server and would let people see information from the Riot League of Legends API.
Afterwards web pages were added using thymeleaf, and it now shows stats of the Support Stole My Blue group, as well as allowing people to find any Summoner + more.

## Properties file
In order to run the application, some properties need to be set.
A list of all the properties can be found here:

    API_KEY_RIOT=
    SHELL_USER=user
    SHELL_PASSWORD=password
    SHELL_HOST=0.0.0.0
    SHELL_PORT=2222
    SERVER_PORT=
    HTTP_PORT=
    SSL_REDIRECT_PORT=
    SSL_ENABLED=false
    KEY_STORE=
    KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=
    KEY_STORE_TYPE=
    KEY_ALIAS=



TODO: add information on what the properties do and if they are mandatory to fill or not.
